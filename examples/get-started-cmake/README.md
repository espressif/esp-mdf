# get_started Example using CMAKE

## Introduction

It introduces a quick way to build an ESP-MESH network without a router. For another detailed network configuration method, please refer to [examples/function_demo/mwifi](../function_demo/mwifi/README.md). Before running the example, please read the documents [README](../../README_en.md) and [ESP-MESH](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/api-guides/mesh.html).

## Configure

To run this example, you need at least two development boards, one configured as a root node, and the other a non-root node. In this example, all the devices are non-root nodes by default.

- Root node: There is only one root node in an ESP-MESH network. `MESH` networks can be differentiated by their `MESH_ID` and channels.
- Non-root node: Include leaf nodes and intermediate nodes, which automatically select their parent nodes according to the network conditions.

You need to go to the submenu `Example Configuration` and configure one device as a root node, and the others as non-root nodes with `make menuconfig`.

You can also go to the submenu `Component config -> MDF Mwifi`, and configure the ESP-MESH related parameters like max number of layers, the number of the connected devices on each layer, the broadcast interval, etc.

## Run

1. Set the event callback function; 
2. Initialize wifi, and start ESP-MESH;
3. Create an event handler function:
	- Non-root nodes send the data packet `Hello root!` to the root node at an interval of three seconds, and wait for its reply;
	- The root node replies `Hello node！` when it receives the data.
4. Create a timer: print at the specified time the ESP-MESH network information about layers, the signal strength and the remaining memory of the parent node.

The root node log would look like this:
