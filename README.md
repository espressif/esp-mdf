# ESP-WIFI-MESH Development Framework [[中文]](./README_cn.md)

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.com/projects/espressif-esp-mdf/badge/?version=latest)](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-mdf/en/latest/?badge=latest)

ESP-MDF, or Espressif Mesh Development Framework, is a development framework for [ESP-WIFI-MESH](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/api-guides/mesh.html), a networking protocol built on top of the Wi-Fi protocol. ESP-MDF is based on the [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/overview) chip.

## Overview
ESP-MDF is based on the [ESP-WIFI-MESH](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/api-guides/mesh.html) protocol stack to facilitate your development of ESP-WIFI-MESH. ESP-MDF provides the following features:

* **Fast network configuration**: In addition to manual configuration with the network configuration apps, such as ESP-WIFI-MESH App or similar third-party apps, ESP-MDF offers a chained way of network configuration, during which devices autonomously and quickly establish a network, and form a greater coverage area.

* **Stable upgrade**: The upgrading process has become more efficient with such features as automatic retransmission of failed fragments, data compression, reverting to an earlier version, firmware check, etc.

* **Efficient debugging**: Various debugging approaches are supported, such as wireless transmission of logs and wireless debugging, debugging through a command terminal, etc.

* **LAN control**: Network can be controlled by an app, sensor, etc.

* **Various application demos**: It offers comprehensive solutions based on ESP-WIFI-MESH in the areas of lighting, etc.

## Framework

ESP-MDF consists of Utils, Components and Examples (see the below figure). Utils is the encapsulation and third-party library of ESP-IDF APIs. Components are the ESP-MDF functional modules that use Utils APIs. Examples are the ESP-WIFI-MESH solutions based on the Components.

### Quick Start(Make)

This section provides the steps for quick start with your development of ESP-MDF applications. For more details, please refer to [ESP-IDF Get Started](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/get-started/index.html).

The directory ``~/esp`` will be used further to install the compiling toolchain, ESP-MDF and demo programs. You can use another directory, but make sure to modify the commands accordingly.

1. [**Setup Toolchain**](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v3.2.2/get-started/index.html#setup-toolchain): please set up according to your PC's operating system ([Windows](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v3.2.2/get-started/windows-setup.html), [Linux](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v3.2.2/get-started/linux-setup.html) or [Mac OS](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v3.2.2/get-started/macos-setup.html)).

2. **Get ESP-MDF**:
    ```shell
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-mdf.git
    ```
    If you clone without the `--recursive` option, please navigate to the esp-mdf directory and run the command `git submodule update --init --recursive`

3. **Set up ESP-MDF Path**: Toolchain uses the environment variable ``MDF_PATH`` to access ESP-MDF. The setup of this variable is similar to that of the variable ``IDF_PATH``. Please refer to [`Add IDF_PATH to User Profile`](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/get-started/add-idf_path-to-profile.html).
    ```shell
    export MDF_PATH=~/esp/esp-mdf
    ```

4. **Start a Project**: The word *project* refers to the communication example between two ESP-WIFI-MESH devices.
    ```shell
    cp -r $MDF_PATH/examples/get-started/ .
    cd  get-started/
    ```

5. **Build and Flash**: Only the serial port number needs to be modified. For the rest, just keep the default configuration untouched.
    ```shell
    make menuconfig
    make erase_flash flash
    ```

6. [**Monitor/Debugging**](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/get-started/idf-monitor.html): If you want to exit the monitor, please use the shortcut key ``Ctrl+]``.
    ```shell
    make monitor
    ```

7. **Update ESP-MDF**:
    ```shell
    cd ~/esp/esp-mdf
    git pull
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

    ```
    If you clone without the `--recursive` option, please navigate to the esp-mdf directory and run the command `git submodule update --init`

3. **Set up ESP-MDF Path**: Toolchain uses the environment variable ``MDF_PATH`` to access ESP-MDF. The setup of this variable is similar to that of the variable ``IDF_PATH``. Please refer to [`Add IDF_PATH & idf.py PATH to User Profile (CMake)`](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/get-started-cmake/add-idf_path-to-profile.html).
    ```shell

    ```shell
    cp -r $MDF_PATH/examples/get-started/ .
    cd  get-started/
    ```

    git pull
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

## ESP-WIFI-MESH Highlights

* **Easy setup**: ESP-WIFI-MESH expands the original Wi-Fi hotspot range to the reach of the most distant node in the mesh cloud. Such a network is automatically formed, self-healing and self-organizing. It saves the efforts of laying cables. All you need to do is configure the router password.

* **Gateway free**: The decentralized structure of ESP-WIFI-MESH with the absence of a gateway precludes the overall network breakdown if one single node fails. Even if there is a single ESP-WIFI-MESH device, the network still works as usual.

* **Safer transmission**: Both the data link layer and the application layer can be encrypted.

* **More reliable transmission**: The transmission and data flow control between two devices are more reliable. Also, unicast, multicast and broadcast transmissions are supported.

* **Large network capacity**: ESP-WIFI-MESH takes the form of a tree topology, so one single device can connect to 10 devices at maximum, and an entire network can have over 1,000 nodes.

* **Wider transmission coverage**: The transmission distance between two devices is 30 m through walls, and 200 m without any obstacles in between (relevant to ESP32-DevKitC).
    * **Smart Home**: Even if there are only three to five devices in your home, they can form a network and communicate with one another through walls.
    * **Street light**: If ESP-WIFI-MESH is used for the street lighting scenario, two long-distance devices can communicate with each other.

* **High transmission speed**: For Wi-Fi transmission, the speed can reach up to 10 Mbps.
    * **Environment Control System**: Directly transfers the raw data collected by sensors and analyzes mass data for calibration of algorithms, thereby improving sensors' accuracy.
    * **Background Music System**: Both audio and video transmissions are supported.
    
* **Simultaneously run Wi-Fi and BLE protocol stacks**: ESP32 chips can run both Wi-Fi and BLE protocol stacks side by side and use ESP-WIFI-MESH as the main network to transmit data, receive BLE probe beacon, send BLE broadcasts and connect BLE devices.
    * **Items tracing**: Monitors the BLE or Wi-Fi data packets from a device at multiple selected spots.
    * **Pedestrian counting**: Through monitoring Wi-Fi probe request frames.
    * **Indoor positioning**: Each device functions as a Beacon AP, continuously sending Bluetooth signal to the surroundings. The network can analyze a device's signal intensity and calculate its current position.
    * **Product promotion**: Sends real-time product information and promotions through iBeacon.
    * **Bluetooth gateway**: With each device serving as a Bluetooth gateway, traditional Bluetooth devices can also be connected to an ESP-WIFI-MESH network.
